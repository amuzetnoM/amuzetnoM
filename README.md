Welcome to my space. I build at the edge of **AI, blockchain, and open-source**—designing systems and tools that empower autonomy, creativity, and collaboration.

---

### **What I Do**

- **Founder @ Artifact Virtual**  
  A collective dedicated to digital sovereignty, decentralized infrastructure, and the fusion of art with technology.

- **Engineer & Technologist**  
  Focused on building scalable, self-sustaining systems that serve creators, communities, and future-forward thinkers.

- **Creative Technologist**  
  I blend systems thinking with aesthetics, exploring how intelligent tools can empower the individual.

---

### **What I Value**

- **Execution > Hype**  
  Ideas mean nothing without action. I prototype fast, iterate hard, and ship what matters.

- **Sovereignty by Design**  
  Everything I build aims to give users control—of their data, tools, and creative freedom.

- **Community as Infrastructure**  
  Collaboration isn't a feature—it's a foundation.

---

### **Current Focus**

- Building decentralized ecosystems with real-world utility  
- Developing AI-integrated workflows and open-source tooling  
- Empowering autodidacts, innovators, and creators

### **Let’s Connect**

Hey, I’m amuzetnoM

I’m building at the edge of AI, blockchain, and open-source—crafting tools, systems, and communities that empower autonomy, creativity, and collaboration.

Founder @ Artifact Virtual, a collective focused on digital sovereignty, decentralized infrastructure, and the fusion of art with technology.

My focus:

Developing scalable, self-sustaining ecosystems

Designing for creators, autodidacts, and innovators

Prototyping the future of human-tech synergy


I believe in radical execution, elegant code, and ideas that outlive hype.

Let’s build something real.
